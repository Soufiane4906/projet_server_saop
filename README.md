# SOAP Server Project

## Description
This project is a SOAP web service server that manages client requests for a specific domain (e.g., student management). It provides a robust backend service using Java, Hibernate, and the H2 database to handle data operations.

### Features
- Exposes SOAP endpoints for client interaction.
- Implements a Hibernate-based data access layer for persistence.
- Utilizes an in-memory H2 database for quick data storage and retrieval.
- Supports standard CRUD operations via SOAP requests.

## Technologies Used
- Java 17
- Spring Framework (if applicable)
- Hibernate ORM
- H2 Database
- Apache Maven

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 installed on your machine.
- Maven for dependency management.
- An IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) for development.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Soufiane4906/SAOP_SERVER.git
   cd SAOP_SERVER
   ```

2. Build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Run the server:
   - Use your IDE to run the main class or execute:
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

### Usage
- The server will be running on `http://localhost:8080`.
- You can use a SOAP client (like SoapUI or Postman) to interact with the endpoints.
- The WSDL can usually be accessed at `http://localhost:8080/ws`.

### Endpoints
- Describe the available SOAP endpoints here, along with the expected request and response formats.
